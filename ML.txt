1. Linear Regression
To understand the working functionality of Linear Regression, imagine how you would arrange random logs of wood in increasing order of their weight. There is a catch; however – you cannot weigh each log. You have to guess its weight just by looking at the height and girth of the log (visual analysis) and arranging them using a combination of these visible parameters. This is what linear regression in machine learning is like.

In this process, a relationship is established between independent and dependent variables by fitting them to a line. This line is known as the regression line and is represented by a linear equation Y= a *X + b.

In this equation:

Y – Dependent Variable
a – Slope
X – Independent variable
b – Intercept
The coefficients a & b are derived by minimizing the sum of the squared difference of distance between data points and the regression line.

Types of Machine Learning Algorithms
Machine learning algorithms are classified into 4 types:

Supervised
Unsupervised Learning
Semi-supervised Learning
Reinforcement Learning

Supervised Learning
Supervised learning is a machine learning approach where algorithms learn from labeled data. The algorithm receives input data and corresponding correct output labels in this process. The objective is to train the algorithm to predict accurate labels for new, unseen data. Examples of supervised learning algorithms include:

Decision Trees
Support Vector Machines
Random Forests
Naive Bayes
These algorithms can be used for classification, regression, and time series forecasting tasks. Supervised learning is widely used in various domains, including healthcare, finance, marketing, and image recognition, to make predictions and gain valuable insights from data.

Unsupervised Learning
In this machine learning approach, algorithms analyze unlabeled data without predefined output labels. The objective is to discover patterns, relationships, or structures within the data. Unlike supervised learning, unsupervised learning algorithms work independently to uncover hidden insights and group similar data points together. Common unsupervised learning techniques include clustering algorithms like:

K-means
Hierarchical clustering
Dimensionality Reduction Methods like PCA and t-SNE
Semi-supervised Learning
Semi-supervised learning is a hybrid machine learning approach that combines labeled and unlabeled data for training. It leverages the limited labeled data and a larger set of unlabeled data to improve the learning process. The idea is that the unlabeled data provide additional information and context to enhance the model's understanding and performance. By utilizing the unlabeled data effectively, semi-supervised learning can overcome the limitations of relying solely on labeled data. This approach is particularly useful when acquiring labeled data is expensive or time-consuming. Semi-supervised learning techniques can be applied to various tasks, such as classification, regression, and anomaly detection, allowing models to make more accurate predictions and generalize better in real-world scenarios.

Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement learning is a machine learning algorithm inspired by how humans learn from trial and error. Here, an agent interacts with an environment and learns to make optimal decisions to maximize cumulative rewards. The agent receives feedback through rewards or penalties based on its actions. The agent learns to take actions that lead to the most favorable outcomes over time. It is commonly used in robotics, game playing, and autonomous systems. It enables machines to learn from their experiences, adapt to changing environments, and achieve long-term goals through a sequence of actions. This dynamic approach to learning makes reinforcement learning a powerful technique for tackling complex decision-making problems.

However, these four types of ml algorithms are further classified into more types.
